# Traffic-Condition-Recognition-Using-The-K-Means-Clustering-Method
Prediction of travel time has major concern in the research domain of Intel- ligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Clustering strategy can be used as a powerful tool of discovering hidden knowledge that can easily be applied on historical traffic data to predict accurate travel time. In our Modified K-means Clustering (MKC) approach, a set of historical data is portioned into a group of meaningful sub- classes (also known as clusters) based on travel time, frequency of travel time and velocity for a specific road segment and time group. The information from these are processed and provided back to the travellers in real time. Traffic flow modelling and driving condition analysis have many applications to various areas, such as Intelligent Trans- portation Systems (ITS), adaptive cruise control, pollutant emissions dispersion and safety.
